Welcome, I am Konstantinos and a member of Biomed STADIUS at ESAT, KU Leuven in Belgium as a PhD student. There along with my supervisors [Prof. Maarten De Vos](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?id=203), [Dr. Christos Chatzichristos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoschatzichristos/?originalSubdomain=be) and [Prof. Johan Suykens](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/members/suykens.html), we are interested in <b>Multimodal Fusion</b> through learning processes.  

Our goals are to find the best ways to allow modalities to combine information from each other, tolerate the absence of a modality subset and through multiple sources enhance our model calibration.

Before joining Biomed, I was a part of PSI group as a master student at the same building working on uncertainty for autonomous vehicles. <b>Bayesian Model Average </b> approximations and the CityScapes dataset was combined to create a pixel-level <b>Active Learning</b> schema for semantic segmentation. I had the chance to be supervised with [Ir. Mark Proesmas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-proesmans-a616065/?originalSubdomain=be), [Ir. Jonas Heylen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-heylen/?originalSubdomain=be) and [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luc-van-gool-1b4a689/?originalSubdomain=ch)
